It includes information on orders, products, sales, profits, customer demographics, and shipping details. This dataset allows us to perform detailed analyses and uncover valuable insights to improve business operations.
Objectives:

2. Key Findings
Sales Trends Over Time:
•	Monthly Analysis: Sales peak during the holiday seasons, particularly in November and December.
•	Quarterly Analysis: Q4 consistently shows the highest sales, followed by Q1, Q2, and Q3.
•	Yearly Analysis: There is a steady increase in sales year-over-year, indicating business growth.
Profitability by Category and Sub-Category:
•	Most Profitable Categories: Technology and Office Supplies lead in profit margins.
•	Least Profitable Categories: Furniture shows lower profit margins, especially in the "Tables" sub-category.
•	Sub-Category Insights: "Copiers" and "Phones" in the Technology category have the highest profit margins, while "Bookcases" and "Tables" are less profitable.
Impact of Discounts:
